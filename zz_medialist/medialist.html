    <h1>Twelve Photobooks Tristen Feels Speak to The Soul of America</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Tristen Rouse. At home, in my living room, I have a bookshelf. Well, I have half a bookshelf. The other half is my girlfriend’s — we did a whole “his and hers'' thing. Anyway. Two of my shelves are entirely dedicated to books of photography, and as I’ve studied photography I have developed a particular interest in books of documentary photography that focus on American life and culture. They may not have been made by American photographers. They may not have even been entirely photographed in America. Yet, these are 12 books I feel speak to the soul of this country.</p>
