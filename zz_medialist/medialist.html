    <h1>Twelve Photobooks Tristen Feels Speak to The Soul of America</h1>
    <p>As I’ve studied photography I have developed a particular interest in books of documentary photography that focus on American life and culture. Some of these books are historical — they focus on important elements of American history and have been made by notable practicioners of documentary photography. Some help us realize that those "historical" problems live with us every day. And others are more benign. The exist to show us hidden, beautiful features of our nation and culture.</p>
    <p>They may not have been made by American photographers. They may not have even been entirely photographed in America. Yet, these are 12 books I feel speak to the soul of this country.</p>

    <h2>The Americans</h2>
    <p>By Robert Frank</p>
    <p>Frank's dark view of American culture and racial segregation meant it was unpopular when it was first published in the United States. Frank also routinely used unusual focus, low lighting and cropping, photographic techniques that earned their own criticism. The magazine Popular Photography described Frank's images as "meaningless blur, grain, muddy exposures, drunken horizons and general sloppiness." Over time, though, The Americans has become an icon of documentary photography. In 2014, the Guardian called it the most influential photography book of the 20th century, noting that it "changed the nature of photography, what it could say and how it could say it." </p>

    <h2>The Atmosphere of Crime, 1957</h2>
    <p>By Gordon Parks</p>
    <p>Gordon Parks was a staff photographer at LIFE Magazine when he was asked to undertake a six week assignment to explore crime in the United States. The resulting photographs published in a series of articles and in an eight-page photo essay. The images rejected stereotype and instead gave an empathetic view of the economic and societal factors that contributed to criminal behavior and law enforcement. A product of a collabortation between the Gordon Parks Foundation and the Museum of Modern Art, The Atmosphere of Crime, 1957 features previously unpublished pictures from Parks' origianl assignment.</p>

    <h2>The Ballad of Sexual Dependency</h2>
    <p>By Nan Goldin</p>
    <p>The Ballad of Sexual Dependency was envisioned as a slideshow, set to music and shown to photographer Nan Goldin's friends. Eventually, it was shown in public at the Whitney Biennial in New York and then published as a photobook. The images are taken as snapshots and are an autobiography of Goldin's life and friends in 1970s and 1980s New York City. Over time, Goldin has periodically released new editions of the book, writing new epilogues that reflect on the work and how she has viewed it as time passed.</p>

    <h2>Portraits and Dreams</h2>
    <p>By Wendy Ewald</p>
    <p>Beginning in 1976, Wendy Ewald taught photography to schoolchildren in rural Appalachia. She asked the children to photograph their "dreams and fantasies" and to focus their cameras on their own personal lives, families and imaginations. In the years since, she has reconnected with her former students to create a PBS documentary on their experiences together, and curated a show of one former student's work for Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit.</p>

    <h2>From Uncertain to Blue</h2>
    <p>By Keith Carter</p>
    <p>Keith Carter's book From Uncertain to Blue began as an anniversary gift to his wife Patricia. Together, they traveled to tiny towns in Texas with unusual names — names like Diddy Waw Diddy, Poetry, Uncertain and Blue. Carter made multiple pictues in each town, then chose one picture to represent that town in his book. The result is a subliminal piece of fine are photography that evokes the essence of small-town life. Later editions of the book have included insights into his creative process, including some of his contact sheets, and Patricia Carter's notes from their time working on the project.</p>

    <h2>Sleeping by the Mississippi</h2>
    <p>By Alec Soth</p>
    <p>The renowned photobook publisher MACK describes Alec Soth's Sleeping by the Mississippi as focusing on "America’s iconic yet oft-neglected ‘third coast’." However, it goes on, "the Mississippi is less the subject of the book than its organizing structure. Not bound by a rigid concept or ideology, the series is created out of a quintessentially American spirit of wanderlust." There is little which I could write about the book that would substantively add to that assessment.</p>

    <h2>American Geography</h2>
    <p>By Matt Black</p>
    <p>Matt Black spent six years chronicling designated "poverty areas," places with a poverty rate of 20% or more. He found that in the "land of opportunity," such places are never more than a two hour drive apart. American Geography is the culimation of those six years, which took him across 100,000 miles and through 46 states and Puerto Rico. The pictures are accompanied by notes from Black's journey — snippets of overheard conversations, bus schedules, historical facts, daily news reports and more. </p>

    <p>Over five months in 2017, Elliot Ross and Genevieve Allison traveled the entire 2,000 mile border between the United States and Mexico. The book aims to provide a more nuanced view of life at America's southern border at a time when post-election rehetoric meant it was at the center of the national discourse. </p>

    <h2>American Mirror</h2>
    <p>By Phillip Montgombery</p>
    <p>Phillip Montgomery's American Mirror documents the United States' fault lines during a time of change. Training his lens on those fault lines, Montgomery photographs the opiod crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, police violence and the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement. Describing the work, Kenneth Dickerman of The Washington Post writes, "Montgomery’s photos are stark and cut to the bone, an appropriate reflection of the many traumatic situations he has found himself in." Dickerman continues: "If we have anything that unites us during these turbulent times, it is the sense of being constantly bombarded day after day by crisis after crisis. 'American Mirror' is an eloquent and unflinching reminder of this. It’s not an easy book to look at; it’s not supposed to be.""</p>

    <h2>2020</h2>
    <p>By Peter van Agtmael</p>
    <p>Similarly focused on 2020 and the year of turbulance it brought, Peter van Agtmael's book titled 2020 is a blend of documentary photographhy and diary entries focused on American life through the pandemic, Black Lives Matter rallies and the 2020 election cycle. The diary entries, in the form of text and pictures of his own life blended throughout his assignment work, provide insights into his thought process. In one picture, he sits in front of two screens — one shows his family during a FaceTime call, the other shows half-processed images from an assignment at a funeral home. In one bit of text, van Agtmael questions how the year will be remembered: “What will resonate in a year or a decade? It’s just a bunch of pictures of people with masks.” </p>

    <h2>Sorry for the War</h2>
    <p>By Peter van Agtmael</p>
    <p>Sorry for the War, Peter van Agtmael's second book on this list, is a book about America that is only half-located in America. The other half finds itself in various locations in the Middle East, zones of American war and conflict, as the book reckons with the reality of those conflicts and Americans' understanding of them. Images of war are juxtaposed with images of military funerals and political campaign parties. A screenshot of an ISIS torture video is juxtaposed with a screenshot of an American military recruitment video and screenshots of American politics speeches. It is van Agtmael's fourth book having to do with America's post-9/11 reality, and damning in its indictment of American nationalism, militarism, and myth-making. </p>
