    <h1>Seven Places Alec Soth Photographed in 'Sleeping by the Mississippi'</h1>
    <p>Alec Soth’s ‘Sleeping by the Mississippi’ is an extraordinary document of visual exploration. It was one of the first photography books that I ever owned, and one of the first photography projects I came across that introduced me to a slower, more exploratory method of visual storytelling. It also introduced me to the idea that a story could be about a place or a journey, where one explores themes and concepts, rather than a person with a narrative story. In the book, Soth photographs a variety of people and places on his journey down the Mississippi River. Knowing the locations will not mean you know the photographs or their power or what Soth sees in them as he navigates his own dream through its waters. But we must start somewhere. </p>
