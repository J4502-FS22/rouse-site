      <h1>How To Read Photobooks</h1>
      <p>Do you have a library full of photography books and no idea how to actually incorporate
them into your own artistic practice? Well then do I have the guide for you! Looking at and
understanding the work that has come before you is a vital part of being in conversation with
that work, understanding aesthetic and storytelling methods, and developing your own vision as
a photographer. And now, with this super straightforward guide, you’ll know how the greats do it.</p>
    <p>(Editor’s note: This guide is a work of satire and not meant to be taken literally. It’s primary
purpose is to induce a chuckle and bring some lightheartedness to Tristen’s Awesome Website.)</p>
