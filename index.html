    <p>Hello, I'm Tristen Rouse and I'm a documentary photographer and photo editor, currently studying at the Missouri School of Journalism. I am also an amateur photobook collector.</p>
    <p>My journey with photography began as a freshman at the Missouri School of Journalism, when I was inspired to switch from a reporting emphasis to a photojournalism emphasis. My journey with photobooks began shortly after that, when a fellow student showed him Alec Soth’s “Sleeping by the Mississippi.” I was hooked. There was something about the medium — its tactile nature, its inclusion of writing and design, its ability to give photographers sole authorship of how their images were sequenced and presented — that wedged itself deep in my heart.</p>
    <p>Today, I own my own copy of “Sleeping by the Mississippi,” as well as other photobooks and zines by photographers famous and unknown, historical and contemporary. It is my hope that as I continue to grow and develop my visual eye (and my bank account) I can continue to add to my library. Many of my books — a disproportionate amount, really — deal with American culture and struggle. It’s a subject of interest in my own photography and so it makes sense that those inspirational works would be found on my shelf.</p>
    <p>This site contains a page dedicated to those books. It also contains a page dedicated to Soth’s “Sleeping by the Mississippi,” and a page that is my attempt at visual humor. Enjoy.</p>
